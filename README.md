## Overview

This repository is an archive for my first project solution during my virtual internship with Prodigy InfoTech. It focuses on building a classification model to predict survival on the Titanic using logistic regression.

- **Objective:** Build a Titanic Classification Model Using the Logistic Regression Model
- **Dataset:** [Link to my dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **Submission Date:** December 20, 2023
- **Author:** SUNMOLA M.A (sunmolaadeyanju@gmail.com)

## Data Cleaning & Initial Exploration

- Imported necessary libraries
- Loaded the dataset
- Explored the dataset's size and structure
- Handled inconsistencies and missing values
- Checked for data type consistency
- Checked for and dropped duplicate entries

## Exploratory Data Analysis + Data Visualization

- Explored basic statistics of the data
- Visually explored all dataset feature relationships
- Visualized target distribution
- Visualized Gender distribution
- Visualized Social class distribution
- Visualized Gender vs. Survival relationship
- Visualized Social class vs. Survival relationship

## Data Preprocessing

- Feature engineering (handling categorical variables)
- Feature selection
- Train-test split

## Model Building & Evaluation

- Developed a Logistic Regression Model
- Trained the model on the training dataset
- Evaluated the model performance on the training dataset
- Trained and evaluated the model on the test dataset
- Submitted predictions on Kaggle to evaluate the overall model performance

## Submission on Kaggle

- Created a prediction based on the test dataset
- Created a submission file in CSV format
- Submitted predictions on the Kaggle competition

## Conclusion

Upon submitting the `submission.csv` file on the Kaggle competition, the model achieved a metric score of approximately 77.03%, indicating a reasonable level of accuracy.
